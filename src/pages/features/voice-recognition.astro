  <h2 id="voice-commands">Voice Commands</h2>
  <p>
    Shopis recognizes a wide variety of voice commands. Here are the most useful ones:
  </p>

  <h3>Adding Items</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>"Add [item] to my list"</li>
    <li>"I need [item]"</li>
    <li>"Put [item] on my grocery list"</li>
    <li>"Add [quantity] [item]" (e.g., "Add two pounds of ground beef")</li>
    <li>"Add [brand] [item]" (e.g., "Add Heinz ketchup")</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>List Management</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>"Create a new list called [name]"</li>
    <li>"Show me my [list name]"</li>
    <li>"Delete [item] from my list"</li>
    <li>"Mark [item] as purchased"</li>
    <li>"Clear my completed items"</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Information Queries</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>"How many items are on my list?"</li>
    <li>"What's my budget for this month?"</li>
    <li>"How much have I spent on groceries?"</li>
    <li>"When did I last buy [item]?"</li>
    <li>"Show me my purchase history"</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Smart Suggestions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>"What should I add to my list?"</li>
    <li>"Suggest items for dinner tonight"</li>
    <li>"What am I running low on?"</li>
    <li>"Add my usual grocery items"</li>
  </ul>

  <InfoBox type="info" title="Natural Speech">
    You don't need to memorize exact commands. Shopis understands natural speech, so "I'm out of milk" works just as well as "Add milk to my list."
  </InfoBox>

  <h2 id="natural-language">Natural Language Processing</h2>
  <p>
    Shopis's natural language processing goes beyond simple keyword recognition:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Context Understanding</strong>: "Add more bananas" understands you want to increase quantity
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Brand Recognition</strong>: "I need Coca-Cola" automatically adds the specific brand
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Quantity Parsing</strong>: "Two dozen eggs" correctly interprets as 24 eggs
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Category Intelligence</strong>: "Add vegetables for salad" suggests lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Meal Planning</strong>: "Add ingredients for spaghetti" adds pasta, sauce, and cheese
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dietary Preferences</strong>: Considers your dietary restrictions in suggestions
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Advanced Natural Language Examples</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>"I'm making tacos tomorrow, what do I need?" → Suggests tortillas, ground beef, cheese, lettuce, etc.</li>
    <li>"Add healthy snacks for the kids" → Suggests fruits, yogurt, crackers based on your preferences</li>
    <li>"We're having guests this weekend" → Asks about meal plans and suggests party supplies</li>
    <li>"I'm running low on cleaning supplies" → Reviews your usual cleaning products and suggests refills</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="multilingual-support">Multilingual Support</h2>
  <p>
    Shopis supports voice recognition in multiple languages and can even handle mixed-language conversations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Supported Languages</strong>: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and more</li>
    <li><strong>Accent Recognition</strong>: Understands various regional accents within each language</li>
    <li><strong>Code-Switching</strong>: Handles mixed-language speech (e.g., "Add leche to my list")</li>
    <li><strong>Product Names</strong>: Recognizes international product names and brands</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural Context</strong>: Understands culturally-specific food items and shopping terms</li>
  </ul>

  <InfoBox type="warning" title="Language Settings">
    Make sure to set your primary language in Settings > Voice > Language for the best recognition accuracy. You can change this setting at any time.
  </InfoBox>

  <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting Voice Issues</h2>
  <p>
    If you're experiencing issues with voice recognition, try these solutions:
  </p>

  <h3>Poor Recognition Accuracy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Speak clearly and at a normal pace</li>
    <li>Reduce background noise when possible</li>
    <li>Complete voice training in Settings > Voice > Training</li>
    <li>Check that your language setting matches your speech</li>
    <li>Update the app to the latest version</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Microphone Issues</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Check microphone permissions in your device settings</li>
    <li>Ensure no other apps are using the microphone</li>
    <li>Test your microphone with other apps to rule out hardware issues</li>
    <li>Clean your device's microphone opening</li>
    <li>Restart the app if microphone access seems blocked</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Commands Not Working</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Try rephrasing your command more simply</li>
    <li>Use the item's common name rather than brand names for better recognition</li>
    <li>Speak the command as a complete sentence</li>
    <li>Check if the feature requires an internet connection</li>
    <li>Review the command examples in this guide</li>
  </ul>
