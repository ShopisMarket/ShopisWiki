  <h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2>
  <p>
    Understanding these key concepts will help you make the most of Shoppis:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Smart Lists</strong>: Your shopping lists automatically organize items by category and can suggest 
      quantities based on your purchase history.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Voice Recognition</strong>: Shoppis understands natural language, so you can speak normally when adding 
      items. Say "Add two pounds of ground beef" and it will understand both the item and quantity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Barcode Intelligence</strong>: Scanning a barcode doesn't just add the item - it includes brand information, 
      nutritional data, and price history when available.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Shared Lists</strong>: Family members can collaborate on the same list in real-time. When someone adds 
      or checks off an item, everyone sees the update instantly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Budget Tracking</strong>: Set spending limits for different categories (groceries, household items, etc.) 
      and get alerts when you're approaching your limits.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Purchase History</strong>: Shoppis remembers what you buy and when, making it easy to reorder regular items 
      and track spending patterns.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Smart Notifications</strong>: Get reminders about items you frequently buy, sales at your favorite stores, 
      and when you're running low on essentials.
